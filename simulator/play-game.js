    If SP goes less than six innings, find a RP with at least two innings to pitch.  (THIS IS THE RELIEFTYPE == LONG)
        Do not allow this pitcher to take the total team innings past eight. START WITH 4TH RANKED PITCHER.

    ED INTERPETATION OF BELOW:  After 5th inning starts, but the 7th innings isn't over:
        If total innings is not a whole number, find a RP that enables the total outs to be a whole inning.

    If the team is winning after five innings, bring in the fourth highest ranked pitcher. (THIS IS THE RELIEFTYPE == MID ONLY) 
        If the fourth ranked pitcher is not available, starting with the 5th ranked pitcher, look for the next lowest ranked pitcher who is available.
    
    If the team is winning after six innings, bring in the third highest ranked pitcher.  (THIS IS ALSO RELIEFTYPE == MID)
        If the third ranked pitcher is not available, bring in the lowest ranked pitcher who is available.
    
    If the team is winning after seven innings, bring in the second highest ranked pitcher.  (THIS IS RELIEFTYPE == FINAL)
        If the second ranked pitcher is not available, bring in the lowest ranked pitcher who is available.

    If the team is winning after eight innings, bring in the highest ranked pitcher. 
        (THIS WOULD BE THE CLOSER) 
    
    If the highest ranked pitcher is not available, bring in the lowest ranked pitcher who is available.
        â‡’ example.. in (b) If #3 ranking pitcher does not have 1 IP, combo him with a reliever below him in the rankings to get to at least 1 IP.
